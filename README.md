# Dento

## Background
Planned a simple backend as a dental management system which majorly facilitates appointments and user management.

Here the system has NodeJs and ExpressJs for API construction. The database used is Postgres.

## Modules

The system will be handling `Users` which are further categorized as `Admins`, `Doctors`, `Patients`. Users will be able to interact with varuios concepts of digital cinic management mainly being their appointment oraganization.

`Appointments` will be another imporatant module where all the activities will be pooled.

The user roles are controlled by their *access permission* which is implemented via JWT authentication.
